    "At this point we've seen a number of criteria and algorithms for fitting regression models to data. We've seen the simple linear regression using ordinary least squares, and its more general regression of polynomial functions. We've also seen how we can arbitrarily overfit models to data using kernel methods or feature engineering. With all of that, we began to explore other tools to analyze this general problem of overfitting versus underfitting. This included train and test splits, bias and variance, and cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to take a look at another way to tune our models. These methods all modify our mean squared error function that we were optimizing against. The modifications will add a penalty for large coefficient weights in our resulting model. If we think back to our case of feature engineering, we can see how this penalty will help combat our ability to create more accurate models by simply adding additional features.\n",
